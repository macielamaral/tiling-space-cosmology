This repository contains the numerical simulation code for the paper **"Emergent Cosmology from Quasicrystal Growth: A Derived Scaling Law."** The code validates the central theoretical claim that a cosmological scale factor, $a(n)$, emerges from the growth of a quasicrystal projected from the 8D E8 lattice, following a parameter-free scaling law:

$$ a(n) \asymp n^{5/6} $$

Here, $n$ represents the discrete growth step (the shell index of the E8 lattice), and $a(n)$ is the emergent scale factor derived from the typical spacing of points in the 3D projection.



## Abstract of the Paper

We model spacetime as a growing quasicrystal generated by shell-by-shell projection of the $E_8$ lattice. Under few geometric assumptions and without cosmological parameter fits, we derive the parameter-free scaling $a(n)\asymp n^{5/6}$ for the emergent scale factor, where $n$ is the discrete growth step. The law follows from lattice combinatorics and outer-scale growth, fixing the exponent independently of cosmology. We define $a(n)$ via a typical spacing (quantile $k$-nearest-neighbor) and show that large-scale simulations exhibit the predicted power-law envelope with characteristic staircase behavior due to discrete shell injections.

## Repository Structure

* `scripts/calculate_e8_scaling.py`: The main Python script that performs the computationally intensive task of generating E8 shells, projecting them to 3D, and calculating the scale factor at each step.
* `data/e8_scaling_data.csv`: The output data generated by the calculation script, containing the shell index `n` and the corresponding scale factor `a(n)`.
* `notebooks/plot_e8_data.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for analyzing and visualizing the results. It loads the CSV data, performs a log-log regression, and generates the final plots that compare the numerical results to the theoretical prediction.
* `results/numerical_scaling_plot.png`: The primary plot generated by the analysis notebook, visually confirming the scaling law.

## How to Reproduce the Results

### 1. Prerequisites

You'll need a Python environment with the following libraries installed:
* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `jupyter`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

### 2\. Run the Calculation

Execute the main script to generate the scaling data. This process is computationally intensive and may take a significant amount of time, as it needs to generate a large E8 point cloud.

```bash
python scripts/calculate_e8_scaling.py
```

This will create the file `data/e8_scaling_data.csv`.

### 3\. Analyze the Results

Once the data is generated, run the Jupyter notebook to perform the analysis and create the plots.

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/plot_e8_data.ipynb
```

Running the cells in the notebook will reproduce the analysis and plots shown in the paper, including the final log-log fit that confirms the $5/6$ exponent.

## Key Result

The core result is the agreement between the numerically calculated slope and the theoretically derived exponent of $5/6 \approx 0.833$. The analysis in `plot_e8_data.ipynb` shows that by fitting a line to the "jump points" of the staircase-like data (which more accurately captures the growth envelope), we obtain a slope that closely approaches the theoretical value.

From the notebook's "Jump Point Analysis":

  * **Log-log slope of the jump points: 0.8318**
  * **Theoretical Target Slope (5/6): 0.8333**

This strong agreement serves as the primary validation for the model presented in the paper.
